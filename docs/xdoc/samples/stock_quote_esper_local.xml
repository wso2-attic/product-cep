            <p>Stock Quote sample is based on Stock Quotes of any Stock Exchange. Before creating the bucket to filter
                stock quotes it is essential
                to have a Carbon broker. Since In this example we are going to use local Broker, it is needed to create
                a broker with type local.
            </p>

            <h3>Creating a broker with type 'local'</h3>

                     alt="CEP Create Local Broker"/>
            </p>

            <pre xml:space="preserve">

                Step 1 :
                Start CEP Server and log in as admin

                Step 2 :
                In the Configure menu you can find a Menu item called "Broker" and under that you can see sub menu 'Add'
                and click on that

                Step 3 :
                You will get a page with header "Create a New Broker" and you need to enter following details in that
                form to create a local broker

                Broker Name : localBroker
                Broker Type : local

                Finally click on Add Broker button and you will get the added broker to the list of available brokers.
            </pre>


            <h3>Create bucket with Esper<span class="super">TM</span></h3>
            <p>Use the "Add" menu in CEP Buckets to add buckets</p>

            <p>**** Note : Before creating the bucket with Esper<span class="super">TM</span>, You should have installed the Esper<span class="super">TM</span> feature to the CEP
                Server.
                In order to install Esper<span class="super">TM</span> back end runtime feature , You need to go through the Feature management
                Console and Install the feature from the
                GPL repository location :

            <h2>Invoking Deployed Bucket</h2>

            <p>When the bucket is successfully deployed, an axis2 service will be automatically created with the name
                you given for the broker name. In this case
                the name of the service will be 'localBrokerService'. This service can be used to send the input event
                stream to CEP engine.
            </p>

            <h3>Defining output subscriber</h3>

            <h4>Standalone Mode </h4>

            <p>
                When the user send events to CEP engine with this service, there should be a subscriber to the output
                topic given, when configuring the query of the bucket,
                to receive filtered events from the complex event processing engine. So before send events to the engine
                we need to have an axis2 service deployed which
                prints received string to the console. Then create a subscription to the output topic , with providing
                the URL of the axis2 service as the subscription
                URL.
            </p>
            <p>You can find the source sample axis2 service "FastMovingStockQuoteService" in the location :
                /samples/services/FastMovingStockQuoteReceiverService
            </p>

            <p>go in to this folder and execute the following command : "ant"</p>

            <p>When you done this , it will place "FastMovingStockQuoteService.aar" file in the location:</p>

            <p>/repository/deployment/server/axis2services/</p>

            <p>you will be able to see the axis2 service in the services list.</p>

            <p>Now create a subscription to the output topic defined when configuring the bucket</p>

            <h4>Stratos Mode </h4>

               <p>In stratos mode , All the topic creations are same other than the "Event Sink URL"</p>

               <p>Here the Event Sink URL should be to the message box you created above.</p>

               <p>this url prepares as follows : sqs://loggedInUserName+/+MessageBoxName </p>

               <p>If my username is "foo" and my message box name is "bar" then the event sink URL
               should be as follows;</p>

               <p>sqs://foo/bar</p>

               <p>So provide the EventSinkURL appropriately.</p>

               <p>Specifically , if you have logged in as shammi@brs.com and my messagebox name is "FastMovingStocks"
               , then Event Sink URL would be;  </p>

                <p>sqs://shammi/FastMovingStocks</p>

               <p>You can test whether this is working fine by publishing a XML element to publish section and
               check the message box.
               </p>



            <h3>Creating topic and subscribing </h3>
                   <p>In order to subscribe, you need to create a topic.</p>
                   <pre xml:space="preserve">
                       Step 1: Click on "Add" menu item under "Topics" Menu in Manage section of the left panel

                       <p><img src="../images/fusion_local_addTopic.png"
               alt="Add Topic" /> </p>
                       Step 2: Specify the topic name in the provided text box , in this case topic name is : "FastMovingStockQuotes"
                               and click on 'Add Topic' button. This will add the topic to the server and you will be directed to the
                               Topic Browser page.
                       <p><img src="../images/fusion_local_topicBrowser.png"
               alt="Topic Browser" /> </p>
                       Step 2: Once you click on the topic in topic browser page you will be able see four links as in the above image.
                               Click in the subscribe link and you will be directed to Subscribe page.

                       <p><img src="../images/fusion_local_subscribe.png"
               alt="Subscribe" /> </p>

                       Step 3: Create subscription with following details, Once you click on the "Subscribe" button, you will be
                               directed to the Topic Browser page.

                        topic              : FastMovingStockQuotes  (Output topic)
                        subscription mode  : Topic only
                        subscription URL   : http://localhost:9763/services/FastMovingStockQuoteService/getOMElement
                        expiration Time    : select a future date from calender

                       Step 4 : You can verify whether you have correctly subscribe to the topic by click on "Details" link of that topic
                               in topic browser page. Once you click on that , you will be directed to the "topic details " page and there
                               you will find all the subscriptions for that topic and its children (if exists) and permission on that topic.

                               Apart from that with the publish section, you can publish a test xml message to that topic and check whether
                               it is received to you subscription URL.

                There are two possible ways that can be used to send input events using this axis2 service.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sending events directly to the axis2 service with the use of Java client.</li>
                <li>Subscribe to a topic with the axis2 service URL and send events to that topic via a client or
                    Publish feature in Topic details.
                </li>
            </ul>

<h4>Subscribe to a topic with the axis2 service URL and send events to that topic via a client or Publish feature in Topic details</h4>


      <p>Invoking the deployed bucket via Publish feature can be tested as bellow</p>


    <p>In order to send a message to a topic via Publish feature , you need to create a topic and a subscription</p>

    <p>Step 01: Create a Topic</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the 'Add' menu item under the 'Topics' menu to create a topic. To create a topic , the only thing
            needed to be provided is the name of the topic. Additionally you can manage permissions about the operations
            such as 'Publish / Subscribe' on that topic. What you need to do is tick or untick the provided check boxes
            and click on 'Add Topic' button.

           <pre xml:space="preserve">
               Here you can provide the topic as : AllStockQuotesTopic
           </pre>

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Step 02: Create subscription to the created topic</p>
    <ul>
         <li>When you added a topic , you will be directed to the 'Topic Browser' page and once you click on the topic name
            four links will be displayed. Click on the 'subscribe' link and you will be directed to "Subscribe" page.
        </li>
        <li> In order to create a subscription , you have to provide two things,
            <ul>
                <li>
                     1. Event Sink URL - This is the URL which is used to send messages when they are published to the topic.
                </li>
                <li>
                     2. Subscription Mode - This is the mode of the subscription , here you can subscribe to topic and its children also.
                </li>
                <li>
                     3. Expiration Time - This time can be configured using the provided calender and if not configured, the
                        subscription will not be expired.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Here we are using this topic to send messages to the Input topic. So the event sink URL in this case is the
            URL of the input topic.
            </p>
            <pre xml:space="preserve">
                Event Sink URL : http://localhost:9763/services/localBrokerService/AllStockQuotes

                Subscription Mode : Topic Only
            </pre>
            <p>
                Click on the button 'Subscribe' and it will create the subscription and direct you to the "topic Browser" page.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Step 03: Publishing message to the topic</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Now you have created the subscription to the topic "AllStockQuotesTopic" and all the messages published to
            this topic will be send to the  event sink URL that you specified.
        </li>
        <li>
            Click on the Topic and its will display for links and click in the 'Details' link. It will direct you to "Topic Details" page.
            On that page you can find 'Publish' Section and you can place your XML message in the provided space
            and click on 'Publish' button to publish message to the topic.
        </li>
    </ul>
